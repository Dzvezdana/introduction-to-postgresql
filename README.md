# Introduction to PostgreSQL

This directory contains a set of basic examples for new PostgreSQL users.
Clone the repository and create a new *exercises* branch. 

Let's start by creating the tables:

* First, familiarise yourself with the [data](##US-President-Database) we're going to use.
* Then execute the queries in [create_db.sql](https://github.com/Dzvezdana/introduction-to-postgresql/blob/master/queries/create_db.sql). 
This will create the tables we need.
* Now lets insert some data into the tables. Execute the queries in [insert_data.sql](https://github.com/Dzvezdana/introduction-to-postgresql/blob/master/queries/insert_data.sql).
* Finally, you can start working on the [exercises.sql](https://github.com/Dzvezdana/introduction-to-postgresql/blob/master/queries/exercises.sql).
 If you're **really** stuck you can take a look at the *solutions* branch.

You can find the documentation here:

* [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/9.4/index.html)
* [Psycopg2](http://initd.org/psycopg/docs/)

Intellij shortcuts:

* Execute queries: `Command` + `Enter`.
* Format queries: `Option` + `Command` + `L`.
